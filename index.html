    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Utah Valley, and I love it here. I have always done well at school,
    and have always had an interest in computers. For that reason, I decided to study computer science
    at BYU and see where my curiousity takes me. I am also a hobbyist who has a wide range of interests
    including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mountain Biking</li>
      <li>Music Production</li>
      <li>Snowboarding</li>
      <li>Longboarding</li>
      <li>Tennis</li>
      <li>Pickleball</li>
      <li>Drawing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Projects:</h2>
    <p>I have been involved in only a few projects since the start of my Computer Science education,
      but they include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>My favorite - a 2D "Capture the Flag" action game that can be found <a href="https://playsnagtheflag.com">here</a></li>
      <li>A simple photo editing application</li>
      <li>A program that could navigate basic mazes</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
    <p>I currently work as an Inside Sales Representative for <a href="https://purple.com">Purple</a>, and have
        been there since June. Prior to my 2-year missionary service in Dnipro, Ukraine (speaking Russian), I worked at a place
        called Pharmatech as a product technician for 4 months. Before that, I worked at Meier's Meats and Fine Foods in the deli for two years.</p>
